##### Video Compression
a Universal compressor does not exist

Knowledge of something should be encoded in a compressor

Video Data
1080 * 1920 = 2M pixels
2M pixels * 3 colours * 8bits = 49.7 Mbits /sec
49.8 Mbits per frame * 25 FPS = 1.2 Gbits per second

but DVB channels range from 5 Mbits per second to 50 Mbits per second 

compression ration of 250 to 25 needed
Lossless compression cannot cope with this amount of information

#### Audio Compression

MPEG compression uses studies of the human ear to remove unneeded audio
